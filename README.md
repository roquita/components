# Generic drivers
## What are generic drivers?
Software that allow us to control different devices (like keypads, lcd16x2, hc50, ...) using any base architecture(like avr, pic, arm, ...).
## How to use?
Just add them to your project(like any other standard library) and implement the base firmware that each one require.
